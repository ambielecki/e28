        The goal of the game is to predict whether your card will be between the dealer's two cards.
        <ul>
            <li>Aces are high</li>
            <li>If you believe the next card is between the dealt cards, click bet.</li>
            <li>If you believe it is outside, pass.</li>
            <li>If your card matches one of the dealt cards you lose double your bet.</li>
            <li>
                Normally you could vary you bet amount based on your confidence,
                but that is too complicated for this exercise
            </li>
            <li>Single deck</li>
            <li>Deck is reshuffled before each game</li>
            <li>Suits are not displayed, but there are 4 of every value</li>
        </ul>
