# Project 1
* By: Andrew Bielecki
* Production URL: <https://e28p1.andrewbielecki.com>

## Outside resources
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - JS free CSS framework
* [CSS Tricks: Sticky Footer](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/) - always forget how to do this
* [Playing cards in Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards_in_Unicode) - easier than images
* [SO: Unescaped HTML In Vue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30877491/display-unescaped-html-in-vue-js) - 
to show the suit ascii

## Notes for instructor
* You can easily cheat, the dealer's hole card is set to start 
(so we can see if the dealer had blackjack).  You'd need a server side API to really hide it.
* Dynamic styling can be seen in the cards' show_card propery (show's the blue back or white face as background)
